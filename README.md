# JavaScript
If you are JavaScript developer who wants to learn JavaScript in depth and also master object oriented java script then this course is for you.
If you are a developer with any other object oriented programming language background and want to implement object oriented java script then this
course is for you too.This course is not for beginners and you should have used JavaScript before you take this course.This course will fill in 
any gaps in your JavaScript knowledge and will help you learn and use any other JS frameworks like ReactJS,NodeJS,AngularJs easily.

JavaScript does not use structures like classes  to implement object oriented programming.This can be confusing for programmers coming from 
Java ,C++ or python background.This course covers every detail of JavaScript types, functions, objects and how JavaScript engine deals with 
them which will clear up any confusion and help you implement your JavaScript applications in a better way.
